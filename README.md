# INST377 Final Project - Foreclosures in PG County (2019-2023)
## Description
I used the PG County Foreclosures API and their border API. I also had to use the geoapify API for geocoding. This project useses leaflet.js to plot foreclosures on the map and flex for css formatting. It filters this data by city and date to display problem areas or times for foreclosures. The links for the APIs are included in the readme file.
